                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nUFx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2f1dce5-914a-44da-a635-61f3c0947adb_750x260.jpeg" alt="City and Community of San Francisco">
                
                <p>In the early 1900s, San Francisco's leaders were eager to transform their bustling but unruly city into a "Paris of the Pacific." After a period of rapid growth and newfound prosperity (population growing to ~350,000 by 1904), former Mayor <strong>James D. Phelan</strong> convened the city's business and "civic" elite to form the <strong>Association for the Improvement and Adornment of San Francisco</strong>. This group's mission was straightforward: <em>"to make San Francisco a more agreeable place to live,"</em> by beautifying streets, parks, and public buildings. Phelan and his peers intended to shed the city's Barbary Coast reputation and outshine rising competitors like Los Angeles and to catch up to the established urban centers of the east — ultimately, they sought to realize the full potential of a city already in possession of so much natural beauty. To accomplish the men decided to commission a comprehensive grand plan for remaking San Francisco along the lines of the great European capitals.</p>
        
                <p>They turned to <strong>Daniel Hudson Burnham</strong>, America's preeminent city planner of the day. Fresh off prestigious plans for Washington, D.C. (1901) and Cleveland (1903), and famed for directing the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Burnham was a leading figure of the <strong>City Beautiful movement</strong>. In September 1904, Phelan invited Burnham to apply his utopian ideals to San Francisco's haphazard streetscape. Burnham arrived with his young associate <strong>Edward H. Bennett</strong>, and with local architect <strong>Willis Polk</strong> as guide, they set up a cottage on Twin Peaks to survey the city from on high. Over the next months, Burnham's team studied San Francisco's topography (drawing parallels to the hills of Greece and Italy) and gathered input from hundreds of citizens and civic groups. The result, delivered to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors in September 1905, was a sweeping masterplan to remake San Francisco into a majestic, orderly metropolis of boulevards, parks, and monumental civic buildings.</p>
        
                <p>Burnham's core motivation was to elevate San Francisco to the status of a world-class city through beauty. Drawing inspiration from the Beaux-Arts and City Beautiful movements—as well as from Paris, Rome, Washington, D.C., and classical antiquity—the plan sought to reframe the city through symmetry, classical order, and monumental design. It was an aesthetic idealism intended to civilize the city's chaotic layout.</p>
        
                <h2>The Main Features of Burnham's Plan</h2>
        
                <blockquote>
                              <p>We must remember that a meager plan will fall short of perfect achievement, while a great one will yield large results, even if it is never fully realized… Our purpose therefore, must be to stop at no line within the limits of practicability. Our scope must embrace the possibilities of development of the next fifty years." - Burnham (1905)</p>p>
                </blockquote>

                  <p>Burnham's plan was monumental in scope. It sought nothing less than to reorganize San Francisco's chaotic layout into a <strong>harmonious Beaux-Arts city</strong> defined by order, beauty, and function.</p>
        
                <p>Burnham was "infatuated with redrawing streets," slicing through the rigid right-angled grid with diagonal boulevards inspired by Pierre L'Enfant's Washington, D.C. and Baron Haussmann's Paris. These wide, tree-lined avenues would connect major destinations and provide elegant promenades. For example, he proposed extending <strong>Market Street</strong>strong> beyond its terminus and adding new diagonal spines (similar to today's Columbus Avenue or Geary Boulevard, but on a larger scale) to improve crosstown travel. At the intersections of these diagonals and existing streets, Burnham envisioned European-style <strong>"rond-point" circular plazas</strong>strong> to gracefully manage traffic and create focal points.</p>
        
                <p>To knit the whole city together, Burnham called for <strong>ring roads</strong> skirting the city's perimeter. Chief among these was a broad <strong>waterfront boulevard</strong> running along the Bay and Ocean shorelines, allowing one to drive "embracing" the city and bypass the clogged downtown core. This concept – essentially a scenic drive encircling San Francisco – foreshadowed the later <strong>Embarcadero</strong> roadway along the bayfront and the Great Highway along the Pacific in West.</p>

                <h3>A Network of Parks and Parkways</h3>
        
                <p>In Burnham's ideal San Francisco, <strong>parks and green space would comprise fully one-third of the city's land area</strong> – an astonishing allocation meant to rival the great park systems of Europe. He planned an interlinked <strong>"emerald necklace" of parks</strong> from the center to the edges of the city. This included <strong>preserving existing parks</strong> (like Golden Gate Park and the Presidio) and <strong>adding expansive new ones</strong>: notably, a vast new park in the city's southwestern hills <em>"more than three times the size of Golden Gate Park"</em>em>. This huge park (about 4,700 acres) would stretch from <strong>Twin Peaks to Lake Merced</strong>, filled with native landscaping and lakes.</p>
        
                <p>He also proposed <strong>linear parkways and boulevards</strong> to connect these green spaces. For instance, a landscaped <strong>parkway down today's Great Highway</strong> along Ocean Beach. In short, Burnham's San Francisco would be draped in green.</p>
        
                <h3>Monumental Civic Center and Cultural Complexes</h3>
        
                <p>At the heart of the plan, Burnham placed a grand <strong>Civic Center</strong>strong> to project San Francisco's cultural maturity. He proposed grouping the city's major civic buildings in a cohesive classical complex – much like an American version of an ancient forum or the Beaux-Arts civic centers then emerging in other cities. This Civic Center would incorporate a new <strong>City Hall</strong>strong> (replacing the old one on Park Avenue), a large <strong>public plaza</strong>strong>, and flanking cultural buildings. Burnham specifically included an <strong>opera house</strong>strong>, a grand central <strong>library</strong>strong>, and even a new <strong>Union Station</strong>strong> for rail – all clustered near Market Street.</p>

                <h2>Iconic Landmarks and City Beautification</h2>
        
                <p>Beyond the broad strokes of streets and parks, Burnham's plan indulged in some <strong>eye-catching set-pieces</strong> – unique design elements meant to awe. One of these was a proposal for a massive cultural and recreational complex atop <strong>Twin Peaks</strong>, called <strong>The Athenæum</strong>. Burnham earmarked the saddle between the two peaks for an acropolis-like hilltop center: a cluster of museums, galleries, and terraces devoted to art and learning. He described <em>"courts, terraces and colonnaded shelters"</em> modeled after classical precedents – specifically likening them to the Poecile of Hadrian's Villa in ancient Rome.</p>
        
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZfjR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F352fcf99-4f1a-494d-9b4b-6082f049e1cd_6204x4710.jpeg" alt="Concept sketch of the proposed Athenæum atop Twin Peaks">
                <p style="color: #6b6b6b; font-size: 0.875rem;"><em>Concept sketch of the proposed Athenæum atop Twin Peaks, reached by a grand staircase rising from the Castro below (foreground).</em></p>
        
                <p>The Twin Peaks Athenæum was to be the <strong><em>"crown jewel"</em></strong> of Burnham's plan. It would include not only the cultural buildings but also surrounding amenities – polo fields, reflecting pools, and <strong>terraced gardens of white marble</strong> cascading down the slopes. To top it off (literally), Burnham proposed an <strong>enormous statue</strong> – a 300-foot-tall female figure personifying "San Francisco" – standing at the Athenæum's edge, raising a torch toward the Pacific. This statue, evocative of the Statue of Liberty, would serve as a beacon "welcoming immigrants from across the endless sea" as they arrived by ship.</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                            <p>"The Athenaeum, so called, should receive some few of the greatest works of art. It would consist of courts, terraces and colonnaded shelters. These latter would be arranged after the manner of the great Poecile of the Villa Hardian. This consists of a wall so built as to collect the warmth of the sun and afford protection from the wind. On either side of the wall is a colonnade with a covered promenade where visitors may walk in the sunshine or the shade without being bothered by the wind. There should also be protected or colonnaded terraces commanding the principal views of the city and parkland. These too, might be modeled on similar terraces commanding the principal views in the Villa Hadrian overlooking the Vale of Tempe".- Burnham</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <h2>Public Amenities</h2>
        
                <p>The plan included many other proposals large and small. In <strong>Golden Gate Park</strong>, Burnham envisioned new museums and formal gardens to enhance its eastern end, creating a formal approach from the city.</p>
        
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!40H2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94af2866-67a7-49bc-ab88-907ed4cc3a8e_6188x4648.jpeg" alt="Golden Gate Park improvements">
        
                <p>In North Beach, he sketched a <strong>terraced overlook on Telegraph Hill</strong>, transforming that hill's crest into a public pleasure ground with sweeping views.</p>
        
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s0v6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b146e80-5633-42c4-8143-015e59579ad8_6282x4746.jpeg" alt="Telegraph Hill terraced overlook">
        
                <p>Along the northern waterfront's <strong>Harbor View</strong>strong> area (today's Marina District), Burnham designated a huge open <strong><em>"Drill Grounds"</em></strong> for military parades and civic gatherings – an open plaza comparable to the Mall in Washington or the parade grounds of European capitals.</p>
        
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!51Db!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c3813dc-5de0-4f4f-bd4c-67a3144b18e7_795x498.gif" alt="Drill Grounds concept">
        
                <p>An expansive <strong>amphitheater</strong> was proposed in what is now <strong>Cole Valley</strong> (near Golden Gate Park's southeast), envisioned for events like horse shows, polo matches, and sports games.</p>
        
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VGSF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3557bfb3-d6af-403d-bc26-d524fdc00bab_6203x4800.jpeg" alt="Cole Valley amphitheater">
        
                <p>Burnham even flirted with the idea of <strong>covering certain streets with decorative arcades</strong>strong>: notably, he imagined <strong>Mission Street</strong>strong> south of downtown as a grand <strong><em>"Arcade"</em></strong> – a glass-roofed promenade lined with shops, inspired by the 19th-century covered passages of Paris.</p>
        
                <p>In sum, the 1905 Burnham Plan painted a picture of San Francisco reborn as a <strong>City Beautiful masterpiece</strong>: broad boulevards cutting graceful diagonals, cars and streetcars circulating easily around a waterfront boulevard, civic buildings radiating dignity from a grand center, and hills crowned with Beaux-Arts monuments visible for miles. It was an ambitious marriage of <strong>function (efficient circulation, open space)</strong> and <strong>form (civic art and beautification)</strong> – or as Burnham himself put it, a modern blend of <strong><em>"order and beauty"</em></strong> for a once-chaotic city.</p>
        
                <h2>The End</h2>
        
                <p>Then came the <strong>catastrophe of April 18, 1906</strong>. The great earthquake and ensuing firestorm leveled much of San Francisco overnight. In theory, this calamity could have been the unlikely catalyst to implement Burnham's plan – a literal <strong>tabula rasa</strong> on which to rebuild a better city.</p>
        
                <p>However, <strong>reality and urgency trumped utopia.</strong> Homeless residents and business owners were in no mood to wait on lengthy civic design debates – they needed to rebuild <strong>immediately</strong>. The city's economy demanded getting shops and factories running again on their original sites. Thus, even sympathetic officials balked at imposing new street layouts that would delay reconstruction for months or years. Reconstruction began <strong>on the old lot lines and street grid</strong> – effectively pre-empting any large-scale reconfiguration.</p>
        
                <p>In the end, <strong>the Burnham Plan failed to materialize.</strong>strong> All of Burnham's original drawings and beautifully colored maps, which had been delivered to City Hall just days before the quake, were themselves destroyed when City Hall collapsed and burned in the 1906 fire. It was a cruelly symbolic loss.</p>

                <h2>Legacy: Lasting Influences (and "What Might Have Been")</h2>
        
                <p>Although the Burnham Plan was never implemented wholesale, it left discernible marks on San Francisco's development and remains a reference point in the city's planning history. Some elements of Burnham's vision did eventually find life, in altered form or at later dates:</p>
        
                <p><strong>The Civic Center:</strong> While Burnham's exact civic center design wasn't built, the idea of a grand civic core did take root. In the 1910s, San Francisco constructed a new <strong>City Hall and Civic Auditorium</strong> and laid out Civic Center Plaza – a grouping of civic buildings very much in the City Beautiful spirit.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Boulevard Improvements:</strong>strong> San Francisco did implement a few of the traffic improvements Burnham had championed. Notably, <strong>19th Avenue was eventually widened</strong>strong> into a major north-south artery (now part of Highway 1) as Burnham had suggested. <strong>Van Ness Avenue</strong>strong> – which Burnham's plan treated as a key north-south axis – was developed into a broad boulevard and later became the route of US-101. Decades on, the city also realized the concept of a <strong>waterfront "ring" road</strong>strong>: The Embarcadero, built as a highway in the mid-20th century (and now a surface boulevard after 1991), runs along San Francisco's northeastern waterfront much as Burnham's encircling boulevard would have.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Parklands and Open Space:</strong> Burnham's ambitious park expansions did not occur fully (the western hills were largely developed as residential neighborhoods rather than a 4,700-acre park). However, some lasting <strong>open spaces</strong> align with his plan. The <strong>areas around Lake Merced</strong> remain open space (golf courses, lakeside park, university campus) and the adjacent <strong>Sigmund Stern Grove</strong> was preserved as a park in the 1930s.</p>
        
                <p><strong>City Planning Consciousness:</strong>strong> Perhaps the Burnham Plan's most important legacy was less tangible: it <strong>elevated the conversation about urban planning in San Francisco</strong>strong>. It was the first time the entire city had been approached as one comprehensive design problem.</p>
        
                <p><strong>What never came to pass:</strong> The most spectacular elements of Burnham's plan – the Twin Peaks acropolis, the grand amphitheater, the sweeping Spanish Steps up the hills – of course were never built. These remain fascinating <strong><em>"what ifs"</em></strong> in San Francisco lore. They occasionally surface in museum exhibits and retrospectives of unbuilt projects.</p>
        
                <p>Today, <strong>San Francisco's urban form</strong> still bears the imprint of decisions made (and not made) in Burnham's time. The basic grid and layout remain as they were before 1906. Yet, in the City's civic architecture, its cherished open spaces, and even its willingness to envision grand projects, one can find echoes of Daniel Burnham's influence. In a way, the Burnham Plan succeeded not in literal implementation, but in <strong>shaping the city's aspirations.</strong></p>
        
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
                <p>The 1905 Burnham Plan for San Francisco stands as a landmark in American urban planning history – a comprehensive City Beautiful design that was at once visionary and impractical. It was born of Gilded Age optimism and Old World romanticism, aiming to impose classical beauty on a booming Western city. Although thwarted by cost, politics, and natural catastrophe, its spirit lived on. San Francisco may never have become the Paris of the Pacific that Burnham imagined, but through his plan the city gained a blueprint of what <strong>could</strong> be – a <strong>benchmark against which future plans would be measured.</strong> To this day, when San Franciscans stroll down a leafy boulevard or admire City Hall's dome against the sky, they are enjoying a city that, in small part, reflects Burnham's enduring dream of <strong><em>"beauty and order"</em></strong> on the shores of the Pacific.</p>
