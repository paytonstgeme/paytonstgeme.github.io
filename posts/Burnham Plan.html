In the early 1900s, San Francisco's leaders were eager to transform their bustling but unruly city into a "Paris of the Pacific." After a period of rapid growth and newfound prosperity (population growing to ~350,000 by 1904), former Mayor James D. Phelan convened the city's business and "civic" elite to form the Association for the Improvement and Adornment of San Francisco. This group's mission was straightforward: "to make San Francisco a more agreeable place to live," by beautifying streets, parks, and public buildings. Phelan and his peers intended to shed the city's Barbary Coast reputation and outshine rising competitors like Los Angeles and to catch up to the established urban centers of the east — ultimately, they sought to realize the full potential of a city already in possession of so much natural beauty. To accomplish this, the men decided to commission a comprehensive grand plan for remaking San Francisco along the lines of the great European capitals.
</p>

<p>
They turned to Daniel Hudson Burnham, America's preeminent city planner of the day. Fresh off prestigious plans for Washington, D.C. (1901) and Cleveland (1903), and famed for directing the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Burnham was a leading figure of the City Beautiful movement. In September 1904, Phelan invited Burnham to apply his utopian ideals to San Francisco's haphazard streetscape. Burnham arrived with his young associate Edward H. Bennett, and with local architect Willis Polk as guide, they set up a cottage on Twin Peaks to survey the city from on high. Over the next months, Burnham's team studied San Francisco's topography (drawing parallels to the hills of Greece and Italy) and gathered input from hundreds of citizens and civic groups. The result, delivered to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors in September 1905, was a sweeping masterplan to remake San Francisco into a majestic, orderly metropolis of boulevards, parks, and monumental civic buildings.
</p>

<p>
Burnham's core motivation was to elevate San Francisco to the status of a world-class city through beauty. Drawing inspiration from the Beaux-Arts and City Beautiful movements, as well as from Paris, Rome, Washington, D.C., and classical antiquity, the plan sought to reframe the city through symmetry, classical order, and monumental design. It was an aesthetic idealism intended to civilize the city's chaotic layout.
</p>

<h2>The Main Features of Burnham's Plan</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  We must remember that a meager plan will fall short of perfect achievement, while a great one will yield large results, even if it is never fully realized… Our purpose therefore, must be to stop at no line within the limits of practicability. Our scope must embrace the possibilities of development of the next fifty years." - Burnham (1905)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Burnham's plan was monumental in scope. It sought nothing less than to reorganize San Francisco's chaotic layout into a harmonious Beaux-Arts city defined by order, beauty, and function.
</p>

<p>
Burnham was "infatuated with redrawing streets," slicing through the rigid right-angled grid with diagonal boulevards inspired by Pierre L'Enfant's Washington, D.C. and Baron Haussmann's Paris. These wide, tree-lined avenues would connect major destinations and provide elegant promenades. For example, he proposed extending Market Street beyond its terminus and adding new diagonal spines (similar to today's Columbus Avenue or Geary Boulevard, but on a larger scale) to improve crosstown travel. At the intersections of these diagonals and existing streets, Burnham envisioned European-style "rond-point" circular plazas to gracefully manage traffic and create focal points.
</p>

<p>
To knit the whole city together, Burnham called for ring roads skirting the city's perimeter. Chief among these was a broad waterfront boulevard running along the Bay and Ocean shorelines, allowing one to drive "embracing" the city and bypass the clogged downtown core. This concept, essentially a scenic drive encircling San Francisco, foreshadowed the later Embarcadero roadway along the bayfront and the Great Highway along the Pacific in the west.

</p>

<h3>A Network of Parks and Parkways</h3>

<p>
In Burnham's ideal San Francisco, parks and green space would comprise fully one-third of the city's land area, an astonishing allocation meant to rival the great park systems of Europe. He planned an interlinked "emerald necklace" of parks from the center to the edges of the city. This included preserving existing parks (like Golden Gate Park and the Presidio) and adding expansive new ones: notably, a vast new park in the city's southwestern hills "more than three times the size of Golden Gate Park". This huge park (about 4,700 acres) would stretch from Twin Peaks to Lake Merced, filled with native landscaping and lakes.
</p>

<p>
He also proposed linear parkways and boulevards to connect these green spaces. For instance, a landscaped parkway down today's Great Highway along Ocean Beach. In short, Burnham's San Francisco would be draped in green.
</p>

<h3>Monumental Civic Center and Cultural Complexes</h3>

<p>
At the heart of the plan, Burnham placed a grand Civic Center to project San Francisco's cultural maturity. He proposed grouping the city's major civic buildings in a cohesive classical complex, much like an American version of an ancient forum or the Beaux-Arts civic centers then emerging in other cities. This Civic Center would incorporate a new City Hall, a large public plaza, and flanking cultural buildings. Burnham specifically included an opera house, a grand central library, and even a new Union Station for rail, all clustered near Market Street.

<h2>Iconic Landmarks and City Beautification</h2>

<p>
Beyond the broad strokes of streets and parks, Burnham's plan indulged in some eye-catching set-pieces, unique design elements meant to awe. One of these was a proposal for a massive cultural and recreational complex atop Twin Peaks, called The Athenæum. Burnham earmarked the saddle between the two peaks for an acropolis-like hilltop center: a cluster of museums, galleries, and terraces devoted to art and learning. He described "courts, terraces and colonnaded shelters" modeled after classical precedents, specifically likening them to the Poecile of Hadrian's Villa in ancient Rome.

</p>

<p>
The Twin Peaks Athenæum was to be the "crown jewel" of Burnham's plan. It would include not only the cultural buildings but also surrounding amenities, polo fields, reflecting pools, and terraced gardens of white marble cascading down the slopes. To top it off, Burnham proposed an enormous statue, a 300-foot-tall female figure personifying "San Francisco", standing at the Athenæum's edge, raising a torch toward the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
In sum, the 1905 Burnham Plan painted a picture of San Francisco reborn as a City Beautiful masterpiece, broad boulevards cutting graceful diagonals, civic buildings radiating dignity from a grand center, and hills crowned with Beaux-Arts monuments visible for miles. It was an ambitious marriage of function and form, or as Burnham himself put it, a modern blend of "order and beauty" for a once-chaotic city.
